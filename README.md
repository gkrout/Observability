# Observability
Monitoring is collecting and visualising data about systems regularly so the system's health can be viewed and tracked.

Three questions of monitoring:
1. Is the service on?
2. Is the service functioning as expected?
3. Is the service performing well?

Monitoring vocabulary:
1. Rate(Throughput): Response per second
2. Duration(Latency): Transaction Response time

Four Golden signals methods(RED+S) from Google SRE handbook:
1. Latency
2. Traffic(Throughput)
3. Errors
4. Saturation(Resouces at 100% capacity)

Telemetry data:
1. The data that is collected for monitoring
2. Used to find where the problem might be
3. Types: MELT(Metric, Event, Log, Trace)
